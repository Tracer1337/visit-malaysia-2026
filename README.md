This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## Legacy-React-App Integration

The sourcecode for the legacy react app is located in the folder legacy-react-app. Some changes were made in the package.json and router component to make it work on the /legacy route.

The build files of the react app are placed in /public/legacy. Together with a set of rewrite rules located inside next.config.ts the build files are served under the /legacy route. Follow these steps to update the build files:

1. Run `npm install && npm run build` inside the legacy-react-app folder
2. Rename the build folder to `legacy`
3. Replace the current `legacy` folder inside the public directory with the new one
4. Commit and push changes
